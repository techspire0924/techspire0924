## 🐣 About Me  
👾 I enjoy building things that are fun, surprising, or just make life easier.  
💻 I’m strongest with **JavaScript**, and I have a growing passion for **Python**—especially for AI and productivity tools.  
🌱 Recently, I’ve been playing with machine learning, interactive web experiments, and anything that sparks curiosity.  
🚀 I like simple ideas that turn into real, working projects.
