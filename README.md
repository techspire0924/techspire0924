## 💫 About Me  
👾 I enjoy building things that are fun, surprising, or just make life easier.  
💻 I’m strongest with **JavaScript**, and I have a growing passion for **Python**—especially when it comes to AI and little productivity tools.  
🌱 Recently, I’ve been playing with machine learning, interactive web experiments, and anything that sparks curiosity.  
🚀 I like simple ideas that become real, working projects.

## 🧩 What I’m Working On  
- An interactive **3D multi-window scene** → I love weird experiments!  
- Python-based tools & AI mini-projects  
- Getting better every day, one small build at a time  

**Demo:** https://techspire0924.github.io/multiWindow3dScene/
